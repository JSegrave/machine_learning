A rate of 90% means that the home care agency provided the recommended process 90% of their episodes of care. Outcome Measures report on the results of the care the agency provided. For example, by the end of an episode of care, did the patient's ability to ambulate improve? A rate of 88% means that the agency achieved that outcome in 88% of their episodes of care.\"_  [ from http://www.homehealthcareagencies.com/resources/medicare-quality-data/ ]\n",

['Home Health Performance Rankings Limitations and Considerations'](http://healthinsight.org/rankings/home-health/131-rankings/246-home-health-performance-rankings-limitations-and-considerations) is a document that describes the data in slightly more detail, pointing out some of its strengths and limitations.

A 'quality episode of care' here refers to a care engagement with a patient that both began and ended with some kind of formal assessment. The assessments then act as a 'before' & 'after' milestone, so that progress can be evaluated objectively."

Almost none of these were reporting any measurements at all, only those in New York were consistently reporting, so all 1212 \"special needs\" rows were removed as it was clear the data could say nothing useful about them.  This is a pity, as it would be interesting to see how agencies that deal with people who have \"special needs\" fare (in comparison to other types of agencies).\n",
      "* Further analysis showed that agencies that did not report \"How often the home health team checked patients for the risk of developing pressure sores (bed sores)\" typically reported little or nothing, so again, these agencies were excluded (982 samples). This is a real pity as pressure sores are horrible to live with, but easily prevented - so it would have been very interesting to have had some outcome data to see if basic prevention checks such as this one are good predictors of other types of outcome.\n",
      "* _\"How often patients wounds improved or healed after an operation\"_ and \"_How often the home health team treated heart failure (weakening of the heart) patients' symptoms_\" were both removed, as they were missing from over 50% of the data each.\n",

      "There were still plenty of missing values, particularly on the behavioural features - e.g. on the 'getting doctors orders', there was 12-16% non reporting. Most of the scikit-learn algorithms used would not accept these blank values, so they had to be imputed (to be the same value as the mean). This is covered more in the [Data Analysis](./exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb) section - see the _Principal Component Analysis_ for more details."
