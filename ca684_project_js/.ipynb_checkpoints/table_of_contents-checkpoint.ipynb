      "This project begins with a dataset, a problem and some hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dataset measures the everyday behaviours of staff in home-based healthcare agencies in the USA. It also measures the outcomes obtained by the patients of those agencies.  e.g. it measures how often staff check their patients for pain and how often the patients ended up in hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that when an agency consistently achieves poor patient outcomes, it can only be detected in arrears from the reporting data. Interventions such as training and inspections can improve the outcomes for _subsequent_ patients. However the _original_ patients still have to suffer through the poor outcomes in the first place before the problem can be detected. \n",
      "\n",
      "The hope is that, using machine learning techniques, we might be able to use the data about everyday staff behaviours to _predict_ which agencies are likely to achieve poor patient outcomes.  If any real patterns exist in the data and if our machine learning techniques can identify them, then it might be possible to intervene earlier and make a significant difference to the lives of those patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this set of IPython notebooks, we will explore the available healthcare data, apply machine learning techniques to it and see if any useful predictions can be made about agency performance."

This was an excellent introduction to machine learning and some of the ideas and techniques were applied in these notebooks, hence any similarities. All the project-relevant code here is my own, however there are a few places where I have re-used code from that book (and also from scikit-learn). Where these occur, they have been clearly attributed."
