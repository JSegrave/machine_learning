      "That said, the analyses to-date have only taken the numeric features of the dataset into account and not the binary features (such as _'Offers Nursing Care Services'_) or categorical ones (such as _'Type Of Ownership'_).  This was by necessity in most cases - e.g. PCA is a distance-based function and there is no meaningful distance to calculate between different _'Type Of Ownership'_ categories.  However, while the binary & categorical data may contain predictive value, it is unclear to me how to make use of them with scikit-learn - all of the examples & tutorials I've read & worked through have dealt only in numeric data.  If time allows, I may revisit this to see how to bring the binary and categorical features into play."
